# Orchard

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused Content Management System built on the ASP.NET MVC platform. You are looking at Orchard 1, the older, .NET Framework-based version that has been in development since 2009.

If you're starting a new project (or maintaining a project built on Orchard 1), you should check out [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore), the new generation of Orchard built on ASP.NET Core. You can also try it for free on [DotNest.com](https://dotnest.com)!

Join the community discussion on [Discord](https://orchardcore.net/discord), where we also have a [channel dedicated to Orchard 1](https://discord.com/channels/551136772243980291/551137194689953848).

## About The Orchard Project

#### Please visit our website at https://orchardcore.net for the most current information about this project.

Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused **Content Management System** built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.

Orchard is built on a modern architecture that puts extensibility up-front, as its number one concern. All components in Orchard can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact presentation that you need for your content.

Orchard is delivered under the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects?searchquery=Orchard&type=project). It is licensed under a [New BSD license](https://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), which is approved by the OSI.

Our mission is to empower our users and foster a dedicated and diverse community that builds the CMS that we all want to use.
